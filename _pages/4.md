Say I'm working with Bob on a novel. Bob and I split up the chapters
so we don't step on each other's toes, but because of a mix-up we both
write the first chapter. What happens when we try to merge our work?

While it would be nice if Git could automatically figure out
which chapter was better, and just use that, that's really hard
to figure out! So whenever there are `merge conflicts`, the
person who's merging needs to figure out what to keep, and what
to take out.
