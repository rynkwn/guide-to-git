Say I'm working with Bob on a novel. Bob and I split up the chapters
so we don't step on each other's toes, but because of a mix-up we both
write the first chapter. What happens when we try to merge our work?

While it would be nice if Git could automatically figure out
which chapter was better, and just use that, that's really hard
to figure out! So whenever there are `merge conflicts`, the
person who's merging needs to figure out what to keep, and what
to take out.

## What does this look like?

When you try to `git merge` a branch that conflicts with
some of your changes, you'll see an error as it merges individual
commits.

This'll

You'll also see this when you type `git status`:
```
git status
# On branch other-branch
# You have unmerged paths.
#   (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
#
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use "git add ..." to mark resolution)
#
# both modified:      tmp.txt
```

If you open up that file, you'll see things like this:

```

[] When you start this level, there'll be a new branch (test_branch) that'll have some conflicts. Merge it into master!
