Say I'm working with Bob on a novel. Bob and I split up the chapters
so we don't step on each other's toes, but because of a mix-up we both
write the first chapter. What happens when we try to merge our work?

While it would be nice if Git could automatically figure out
which chapter was better, and just use that, that's really hard
to figure out! So whenever there are `merge conflicts`, the
person who's merging needs to figure out what to keep, and what
to take out.

## What does this look like?

When you try to `git merge` a branch that conflicts with
some of your changes, you'll see an error like this:

```
Auto-merging txt.tmp
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in txt.tmp
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

The branch will also change a bit to look like `(branch|MERGING)`

You'll also see this when you type `git status`:

```
git status
# On branch other-branch
# You have unmerged paths.
#   (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
#
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use "git add ..." to mark resolution)
#
# both modified:      tmp.txt
```

If you open up that file, you'll see things like this:

```
This is an example, so
<<<<<<< HEAD
this is the change on my branch.
=======
this is the change on the other branch (the one I'm merging into the current branch.)
>>>>>>> other-branch
```

You then have to open the file and edit the conflicting lines so that it makes sense. 
In this case, maybe I think my work makes more sense, so I'll change it as such:

```
This is an example, so
this is the change on my branch.
```

Then, just do your standard `git add` for the file and `git commit -m "Merged"`.

[] When you start this level, there'll be a new branch (test_branch) that'll have some conflicts. Merge it into master!
