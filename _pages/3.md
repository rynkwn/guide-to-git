## Back to the drawing board

```
Master contains commits from Branch A
      ^
      |
      |\ Merge back into Master.
      | \
      |  \
      |   \
      |    | Commit
      |    | Commit
Commit|    | Commit
      |    ^ Commit
      |    | Branch A
      |   /
      |  /
      | /
      |/
      ^
      |
    Master
```

In the figure above, you'll notice that we
eventually "merge" branch A back into master.

We'll look into how to do that here.

## Merging (is complete...)

First, create a new branch off master. Let's call it `exp`.

So: `git checkout -b exp`

Now create a new file. Do some work on it if you want.
Once you've added and committed the file, _go back to master_.

Now, call `git merge exp`.

Since we branched off of master, and created a special new file,
`git merge exp` should be quick, clean, and easy.

If you checkout your list of files now, you should see that
your new file is in master! You can also go ahead and delete
the `exp` branch now.

So remember. When you say `git merge that_branch`, you're saying
you want to merge `that_branch` INTO the current branch!




# Assignment Checklist
Check it with `sh verify.sh 3`!

 [] When you start this level, there'll be a new branch (test_branch). Merge that into master!
