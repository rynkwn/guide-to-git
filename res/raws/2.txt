What are branches?
_________________

You'll notice that when you run through our favorite command,
`git status`, there's a line that says something like
"On branch master".

Branches are a way to organize commits. In industry, they're
usually used to separate work, so that individuals can commit
their work without worrying stepping on each other's toes (like
a cleaner way of everyone on a team simultaneously editing
the same google doc).

Once you're done with the feature, you usually "merge" back into
the master branch so that everyone has access to your work.

Master contains commits from Branch A
      ^
      |
      |\ Merge back into Master.
      | \
      |  \
      |   \
      |    | Commit
      |    | Commit
Commit|    | Commit
      |    ^ Commit
      |    | Branch A
      |   /
      |  /
      | /
      |/
      ^
      |
    Master

Using branches in Git
_________________

1) Create a branch
2) Make changes
3) Checkout to master. (No changes there!)
4) Checkout to branch (Changes are there.)
5) Create a new branch from master.
6) Work on a different set of features.
