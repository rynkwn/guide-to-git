Level 1: Saving your work 

(Status, Add, Commit, Log, and Checkout)
_________________________________________

Let's get comfortable using git.

First, try:
`git status`

You should notice that there aren't any changes.

Now create a file, let's call it `cat.txt`

If you run `git status` again, the file should come up
red. This means that there are changes made to the file
that haven't been saved/committed yet.
