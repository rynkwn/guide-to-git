Baby Steps
_________________

Let's get comfortable using git.

First, try:
`git status`

You should notice that there aren't any changes.

Now create a file, let's call it `cat.txt`

If you run `git status` again, the file should come up
red. This means that there are changes made to the file
that haven't been saved/committed yet.

_________________

Adding Changes
_________________

Add any extra text to the file you want, and then run:
`git add -A` 
(Add all unsaved changes to what we want to commit.)

`git status` will now show the file in green, meaning that
if we were to commit/save now, all our changes to that
file would be committed.

Let's do that!

Run `git commit -m "Important cat.txt changes"`

`git status` will show nothing, because everything so far has been
committed.

You can also run `git log`, which'll display a list of recent commits.
Your change "Important cat.txt changes" should show up at the top!

Now make another change to cat.txt

Let's pretend that the changes are pretty bad. You've poked
something, or your cat ran over your keyboard, and so they
inserted a lot of text all over your beautiful file.
