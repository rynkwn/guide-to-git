Level 0: What is Git?

_________________________________________

Git's a version control system (VCS). 
It's a way to cleanly store files and 
their change history, manage that history 
(e.g., undoing a change if it introduces bugs), 
and to aggregate work by people working in parallel.

More simply: "git stores and manages changes." 
Individuals make changes, and git mushes and 
stores those changes the best it can in a 
repository (the set of changes and their histories).

What is Github?
_________________

Github is a server (and some interface) on 
top of git. It's basically a place where you 
can store changes besides your local computer.

This allows other people to pull/get your set 
of changes, and for them to push/put their set 
of changes onto the same repository/history.

It's also effectively free for most individual use-cases.
