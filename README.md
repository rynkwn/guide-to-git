# Welcome to Ryan's Guide to Git 
An interactive tutorial to git and github. No experience required.

Go to https://rynkwn.github.io/guide-to-git/ for an easier way to view
levels and instructions!

# To install
1) Get `git` if you don't already have it!
Follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for your particular machine.

If you're a Windows user, it should also automatically install something called `Git Bash`.

2) Open up terminal (or Git Bash if you're a Windows user!)

3) Run this command: `git clone https://github.com/rynkwn/guide-to-git.git`

You're done!

# To run

`sh start.sh`

# Github

Integrating with github is unnecessary to learn basic git, but it's a good idea if you want to get your hands dirty what what's common in industry.

To really get the full experience, I recommend creating an account on [Github](https://github.com/).
