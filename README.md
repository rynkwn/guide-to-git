# Ryan's Guide to Git 
An interactive tutorial to git, no experience required.

# To install
1) Get `git` if you don't already have it!

Follow the instructions here for your particular machine: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

If you're a Windows user, it should also automatically install something called `Git Bash`.

2) Open up terminal (or Git Bash if you're a Windows user!)

3) Run this command: `git clone https://github.com/rynkwn/guide-to-git.git`

You're done!
